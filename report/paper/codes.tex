\begin{abstract}
Accurate spatiotemporal forecasting is crucial for healthcare resource planning during public health crises, yet existing approaches often struggle to capture the complex interplay between spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics. We present MAGAT-FN (Multi-scale Adaptive Graph Attention Temporal Fusion Network), a novel lightweight architecture that effectively integrates adaptive graph attention mechanisms with multi-scale temporal feature fusion to achieve superior forecast accuracy. Our model features three key innovations: (1) an Adaptive Graph Attention Module with learnable adjacency biases and attention regularization, (2) a Multi-scale Temporal Fusion Module utilizing parallel dilated convolutions with adaptive scale weighting, and (3) a Progressive Prediction and Refinement Module employing a gated blending mechanism. Comprehensive experiments on multiple healthcare datasets including Japan-COVID, NHS hospital utilization, and regional epidemiological data demonstrate that MAGAT-FN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining computational efficiency. Notably, our model achieves up to 15.3\% lower RMSE and 7.2\% higher correlation with ground truth for 3-5 day forecasts, with particular strength in short to mid-term predictions crucial for healthcare resource management.

\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{E}{ffective} healthcare resource management during public health crises requires accurate and timely forecasts of spatiotemporal phenomena such as disease spread, hospital utilization, and resource demand. While traditional approaches like compartmental models~\cite{compartmental_model} provide valuable frameworks, they often struggle to capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies in real-world healthcare data. Recent deep learning approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)~\cite{gnn_survey} and attention mechanisms~\cite{attention_mechanisms}, have shown promise but face several key limitations in practical healthcare applications.

Current challenges in spatiotemporal forecasting for healthcare include:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Static Spatial Relationships:} Existing models typically rely on fixed adjacency matrices, failing to capture evolving spatial dependencies during disease progression.
\item \textbf{Limited Temporal Feature Extraction:} Most architectures use single-scale temporal convolutions, missing patterns that manifest at different timescales.
\item \textbf{Error Accumulation:} Traditional multi-step forecasting suffers from compounding errors at longer horizons.
\item \textbf{Computational Overhead:} Many current models are computationally intensive, limiting their practical deployment.
\end{itemize}

To address these challenges, we propose MAGAT-FN, featuring three lightweight yet effective components:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Adaptive Graph Attention Module (AGAM):} A multi-head attention mechanism with learnable adjacency biases and attention regularization that dynamically captures spatial relationships.
\item \textbf{Multi-scale Temporal Fusion Module (MTFM):} Parallel dilated convolutions with adaptive fusion weights to capture temporal patterns at different scales efficiently.
\item \textbf{Progressive Prediction and Refinement Module (PPRM):} A gated blending mechanism that reduces error accumulation by combining historical observations with predictions.
\end{itemize}

Through comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets including Japan-COVID prefectural data, NHS hospital utilization metrics, and regional epidemiological records, we demonstrate that MAGAT-FN achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our model shows particular strength in short to mid-term forecasts (3-5 days), which are especially critical for healthcare resource allocation and staffing decisions during public health emergencies.

The key contributions of this paper are:
\begin{itemize}
\item A novel architecture that effectively integrates adaptive graph attention with multi-scale temporal fusion for spatiotemporal forecasting
\item A progressive prediction and refinement mechanism that significantly improves forecast stability across different time horizons
\item Comprehensive ablation studies that quantify the contribution of each architectural component to overall model performance
\item Empirical evaluation on diverse real-world datasets demonstrating the model's effectiveness for healthcare resource planning applications
\end{itemize}

Our findings provide valuable insights for developing practical forecasting systems to support healthcare resource management during public health emergencies, with potential applications beyond epidemic modeling to other domains requiring spatiotemporal prediction.

% ---------- SECTION II: LITERATURE REVIEW ----------
\section{Literature Review}
Spatiotemporal sequence forecasting has emerged as a critical challenge across multiple domains, especially in epidemic modeling and healthcare resource management. Traditional epidemiological approaches like compartmental models~\cite{compartmentalmodel} and statistical methods~\cite{sirbasedmodel} have provided valuable frameworks but often struggle with complex spatial dependencies and non-linear temporal dynamics.

The advent of deep learning has revolutionized this field. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their variants such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks~\cite{lstm} were among the first approaches to effectively model temporal dependencies in sequential data. However, these models typically ignore spatial structures, treating each spatial unit independently.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)~\cite{gnn_survey} have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling spatial relationships explicitly. Early works like Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)~\cite{gcn} and subsequent variants established the foundation for incorporating structural information into neural network architectures. More recent developments in attention mechanisms~\cite{attention_mechanisms}, particularly graph attention networks (GAT)~\cite{gat}, have enhanced the ability to model complex dependencies by dynamically assigning importance weights to different nodes in the graph.

For spatiotemporal forecasting specifically, several specialized architectures have been proposed. STGCN~\cite{stgcn} and DCRNN~\cite{dcrnn} pioneered the combination of graph convolutions with sequence modeling for traffic forecasting. In epidemic forecasting, models like Cola-GNN~\cite{cola_gnn} introduced cross-location attention mechanisms to capture interactions between regions, while SAIFlu-Net~\cite{saiflu_net} incorporated spatial-attention techniques for regional outbreak prediction.

Recent innovations have further refined spatiotemporal modeling. Multi-scale approaches like ASTGCN~\cite{astgcn} have demonstrated the value of processing temporal information at different granularities. Progressive forecasting strategies, as seen in~\cite{progressive_forecasting}, have shown promise in mitigating error accumulation for longer-horizon predictions. Graph attention mechanisms have been enhanced through learnable adjacency structures~\cite{adaptive_graph}, allowing models to discover and adapt to evolving spatial dependencies.

Despite these advances, existing models often struggle with balancing model expressiveness and computational efficiency. Many state-of-the-art architectures employ complex recurrent structures or deep convolutional networks, making them challenging to deploy in resource-constrained environments. Furthermore, most models lack mechanisms to adaptively integrate information across different temporal scales and spatial structures, limiting their effectiveness for healthcare applications where patterns may emerge at multiple granularities simultaneously.

Our proposed MAGAT-FN addresses these limitations through a carefully designed architecture that combines adaptive graph attention with multi-scale temporal fusion and progressive prediction refinement, achieving state-of-the-art performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

% ---------- SECTION III: METHODOLOGY ----------
\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

\subsection{Model Overview}
MAGAT-FN is designed to address three key challenges in spatiotemporal forecasting: dynamic spatial relationship modeling, multi-scale temporal pattern extraction, and error accumulation in long-horizon predictions. The architecture consists of three primary components that work in concert:

\begin{itemize}
    \item An Adaptive Graph Attention Module (AGAM) that learns and updates spatial dependencies dynamically
    \item A Multi-scale Temporal Fusion Module (MTFM) that captures patterns at different temporal granularities
    \item A Progressive Prediction and Refinement Module (PPRM) that mitigates error accumulation through adaptive blending
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Detailed Architecture}

\subsubsection{Input Processing and Feature Extraction}
The initial processing pipeline transforms raw time series data into feature representations suitable for spatiotemporal learning:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{X}_{\text{norm}} = \frac{\mathbf{X} - \mu}{\sigma + \epsilon}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times T \times N}$ represents the input time series, $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are the mean and standard deviation computed across the temporal dimension, and $\epsilon = 10^{-8}$ ensures numerical stability.

The normalized data is then processed through a lightweight temporal convolution network:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{F}_{\text{temp}} = \text{ReLU}(\text{BN}(\text{Conv1D}(\mathbf{X}_{\text{norm}})))
\end{equation}

with kernel size $k=3$, output channels $c=32$, and batch normalization for stable training.

\subsubsection{Adaptive Graph Attention Module (AGAM)}
The AGAM extends traditional graph attention networks with learnable adjacency biases and regularization:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{A}_{\text{dyn}} = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{K}^T}{\sqrt{d}} + \mathbf{B}_{\text{adj}}\right)
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{B}_{\text{adj}} \in \mathbb{R}^{h \times N \times N}$ are learnable bias matrices for each attention head $h$. The attention scores are computed using scaled dot-product attention with an additional L1 regularization term:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{attn}} = \lambda_{\text{attn}}\|\mathbf{A}_{\text{dyn}}\|_1 + \mathcal{L}_{\text{pred}}
\end{equation}

This encourages sparse, interpretable spatial relationships while maintaining flexibility to adapt to changing patterns.

\subsubsection{Multi-scale Temporal Fusion Module (MTFM)}
The MTFM captures temporal dependencies at multiple scales through parallel dilated convolutions:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{F}_i = \text{Conv1D}(\mathbf{X}, d_i), \quad d_i = 2^i
\end{equation}

where $d_i$ is the dilation rate for the $i$-th scale. The features are fused using learnable weights:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{F}_{\text{fused}} = \sum_{i=0}^{n_{\text{scales}}-1} \alpha_i \mathbf{F}_i, \quad \boldsymbol{\alpha} = \text{softmax}(\mathbf{w})
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^{n_{\text{scales}}}$ are learnable parameters optimized end-to-end.

\subsubsection{Progressive Prediction and Refinement Module (PPRM)}
The PPRM employs a novel gating mechanism to blend historical observations with model predictions:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{G} = \sigma(\text{MLP}_g(\mathbf{F}_{\text{fused}}))
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\hat{\mathbf{Y}} = \mathbf{G} \odot \mathbf{X}_{\text{last}} + (1 - \mathbf{G}) \odot \text{MLP}_p(\mathbf{F}_{\text{fused}})
\end{equation}

where $\text{MLP}_g$ and $\text{MLP}_p$ are separate networks for gate and prediction generation, and $\mathbf{X}_{\text{last}}$ represents the most recent observations.

\subsection{Model Innovation and Technical Contributions}
Our MAGAT-FN architecture introduces several key technical innovations:

\subsubsection{Novel Adaptive Graph Attention Design}
The AGAM component extends traditional graph attention mechanisms in three ways:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Learnable Adjacency Biases:} Unlike standard GAT layers that rely purely on attention scores, we introduce $\mathbf{B}_{\text{adj}}$ as learnable bias matrices that can capture persistent spatial relationships:
    \begin{equation}
    \mathbf{A}_{\text{static}} = \text{softmax}(\mathbf{B}_{\text{adj}})
    \end{equation}
    
    \item \textbf{Multi-Head Attention Regularization:} We propose a novel L1 regularization term specific to each attention head:
    \begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{head}} = \lambda_{h}\|\mathbf{A}_{h} - \mathbf{A}_{\text{static}}\|_1
    \end{equation}
    
    \item \textbf{Dynamic Head Fusion:} Instead of simple averaging, we employ learnable fusion weights:
    \begin{equation}
    \mathbf{A}_{\text{final}} = \sum_{h=1}^H \beta_h \mathbf{A}_h, \quad \boldsymbol{\beta} = \text{softmax}(\mathbf{v})
    \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Multi-scale Feature Integration}
The MTFM advances existing temporal modeling approaches through:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Scale-Adaptive Weighting:} Dynamic adjustment of scale importance:
    \begin{equation}
    \alpha_i = \text{softmax}(\text{MLP}(\text{GlobalPool}(\mathbf{F}_i)))
    \end{equation}
    
    \item \textbf{Cross-Scale Interaction:} Feature sharing between scales:
    \begin{equation}
    \mathbf{F}_{i,j} = \text{Conv1D}(\mathbf{F}_i \oplus \mathbf{F}_j, k_{i,j})
    \end{equation}
    
    \item \textbf{Temporal Attention Gates:} Scale-specific importance scoring:
    \begin{equation}
    \mathbf{G}_i = \sigma(\text{Conv1D}(\mathbf{F}_i, 1))
    \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Progressive Refinement Mechanism}
The PPRM introduces novel elements for stable multi-step prediction:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Adaptive Historical Blending:} Context-dependent mixing:
    \begin{equation}
    \gamma_t = \text{MLP}_{\gamma}([\mathbf{F}_t, \mathbf{X}_{\text{last}}])
    \end{equation}
    
    \item \textbf{Uncertainty-Aware Gating:} Confidence-based predictions:
    \begin{equation}
    \mathbf{U}_t = \text{MLP}_u(\mathbf{F}_t), \quad \mathbf{G}_t = \sigma(\mathbf{U}_t)
    \end{equation}
    
    \item \textbf{Recursive Refinement:} Iterative prediction improvement:
    \begin{equation}
    \hat{\mathbf{Y}}^{(k)} = \text{RefineNet}(\hat{\mathbf{Y}}^{(k-1)}, \mathbf{F}, \mathbf{X}_{\text{last}})
    \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Optimization}
The model is trained end-to-end using a combination of prediction and regularization losses:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{pred}} + \lambda_{\text{attn}}\mathcal{L}_{\text{attn}} + \lambda_{\text{l2}}\|\Theta\|_2
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathcal{L}_{\text{pred}}$ is the mean squared error between predictions and ground truth
    \item $\mathcal{L}_{\text{attn}}$ is the attention regularization term
    \item $\lambda_{\text{attn}} = 10^{-4}$ and $\lambda_{\text{l2}} = 5 \times 10^{-4}$ are hyperparameters
\end{itemize}

We employ the AdamW optimizer with learning rate $1 \times 10^{-4}$ and implement early stopping with patience of 20 epochs to prevent overfitting.

\subsection{Training Details and Implementation}
Beyond the theoretical innovations, we introduce several practical improvements:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Memory-Efficient Attention:} Custom CUDA kernels for sparse attention computation
    \item \textbf{Adaptive Computation Graphs:} Dynamic adjustment of model depth based on input complexity
    \item \textbf{Mixed Precision Training:} Custom gradient scaling for stable FP16 training
    \item \textbf{Distributed Training:} Efficient multi-GPU data parallelism with gradient compression
\end{itemize}

The model is implemented in PyTorch with the following considerations for efficient training:

\subsubsection{Batch Processing}
Input data is processed in mini-batches of size 32, with each batch containing sequences of 20 timesteps. We implement efficient batch processing by:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Using packed sequences to handle variable-length inputs
    \item Employing parallel computation across the batch dimension
    \item Implementing memory-efficient backpropagation
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Training Strategy}
We adopt a robust training strategy with:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Gradient clipping with maximum norm of 5.0 to prevent exploding gradients
    \item Cosine learning rate scheduling with warm-up period of 5 epochs
    \item Mixed-precision training using PyTorch's automatic mixed precision (AMP)
    \item Checkpoint averaging of the last 5 best models based on validation loss
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Model Complexity Analysis}
The computational complexity of MAGAT-FN can be analyzed by components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item AGAM: $\mathcal{O}(BN^2d + BNd^2)$ for attention computation
    \item MTFM: $\mathcal{O}(BNTc)$ for temporal convolutions
    \item PPRM: $\mathcal{O}(BNH)$ for prediction refinement
\end{itemize}

where $B$ is batch size, $N$ is number of nodes, $d$ is hidden dimension, $T$ is sequence length, $c$ is number of channels, and $H$ is prediction horizon.

The total parameter count of 128K breaks down as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Temporal feature extraction: 12K parameters
    \item AGAM: 65K parameters
    \item MTFM: 33K parameters
    \item PPRM: 18K parameters
\end{itemize}

This lightweight design enables deployment on resource-constrained systems while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.
