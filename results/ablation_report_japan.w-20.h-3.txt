Component Importance Analysis
----------------------------

1. Adaptive Graph Attention Module (AGAM): Learns dynamic spatial relationships between regions
   Impact when removed: 10.01% RMSE degradation

2. Progressive Prediction and Refinement Module (PPRM): Mitigates error accumulation in forecasts
   Impact when removed: 2.57% RMSE degradation

3. Multi-scale Temporal Fusion Module (MTFM): Processes temporal patterns at different scales
   Impact when removed: 1.77% RMSE degradation

Conclusion
----------

The ablation study demonstrates that the AGAM component contributes most significantly to model performance, with its removal resulting in a 10.01% degradation in RMSE.

While all components contribute positively to the model's predictive capability, the MTFM component shows the least individual impact with a 1.77% RMSE degradation when removed.

The full MAGAT-FN model with all components intact demonstrates superior performance across all metrics, confirming the value of the complete architecture design.
